## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-08

A big release: adds methods, algebraic data types with pattern matching,
generics, an Option/Result prelude with `?T` propagation, and a first-cut
FFI to C. Plus snapshot tests for every example and a Makefile path for
running binaries under vamos.

### Added
- Methods on structs via `impl Foo { ... }` blocks, with `self` resolving
  relative struct paths
- Algebraic data types (`enum`) with three variant shapes: unit
  (`| None`), tuple (`| Some(T)`), and struct-like (`| Point { x: int }`)
- `match` as both a statement and an expression — usable on the right-hand
  side of `let` and inside `return`
- Generic ADTs and a built-in `Option` / `Result` prelude
- `try` / `orelse` / `?T` operators for error propagation through `Result`
- FFI MVP: `extern fn`, `extern struct`, `extern type`, `extern const`,
  `c_*` type aliases, variadic externs, and C-name mapping
- New examples: `methods.exl`, `enums.exl`, `generics.exl`, `ffi.exl`,
  `ffi_full.exl`, `ffi_libc.exl`, `ffi_opaque.exl`
- Snapshot tests: every example now ships a `.expected` file, with
  `verify-host` and `verify-amiga` Makefile targets to diff actual output
- Makefile targets for cross-compiling examples to Amiga m68k and running
  the resulting binaries under vamos; build outputs moved out-of-tree

### Changed
- Codegen lifts block-shaped sub-expressions into `__lift_N` temporaries,
  enabling `match`/`if` to appear inside larger expressions while staying
  C89-compatible
- Internal `Ir` module now owns the typed AST and shared type utilities;
  codegen consumes the typed form without re-deriving types
- CI no longer prebuilds a CI image in a separate workflow — the image is
  built locally as part of the regular pipeline

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-04

Adds three small language conveniences and a debug-friendly codegen flag.

### Added
- `--annotate` flag emits C output with source-line comments, mapping each
  generated chunk back to its `.exl` origin
- `let x = some_tuple()` now binds the whole tuple to a single name (in
  addition to the existing `let (a, b) = ...` destructuring)
- `null` pointer literal, usable wherever a pointer is expected
- Functional update syntax for struct literals: `Point { x: 1, ..base }`
  copies remaining fields from `base` (Rust-style)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-03

Internal refactor: type checking moved into its own pass.

### Changed
- Type checking is now a dedicated `Typecheck` module that produces a
  `checked_program` consumed by codegen. Codegen no longer re-derives types
  while emitting C, shrinking it considerably and clearing the way for
  swappable backends.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-02

Adds aggregate data types and manual memory management: structs, pointers, and
heap allocation. All three land with example files in `examples/`.

### Added
- Struct types: declarations, struct literals (`Point { x: 3, y: 4 }`), field
  access (`p.x`), field assignment, nested structs, and pass-by-value to and
  from functions
- Pointer types (`*T`), address-of (`&x`), dereference (`*p`), and auto-deref
  on field access through pointers (`p.x` where `p: *Point`)
- Heap allocation via `new T { ... }` returning `*T`, paired with `free(p)` —
  typically used with `defer free(p)` for scoped cleanup
- New examples: `structs.exl`, `pointers.exl`, `heap.exl`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-01

First tagged preview. The compiler runs end-to-end: lexer, parser, type
checker, and a C89 code generator. Every feature listed below has a matching
file in [`examples/`](examples/) that compiles to C and builds cleanly under
`cc -ansi -pedantic -Wall`.

### Added
- Core types: `int`, `bool`, `str`
- Arithmetic, comparison, and boolean operators
- `let` bindings, `if` / `else`, `while` loops
- Functions with parameters, return values, and recursion
- Tuple return values (`-> (int, int)`) with `let (a, b) = ...` destructuring
- `defer` statements with LIFO ordering, block form, and early-exit semantics
- Modules (`mod` blocks) with `pub` visibility and `::` path access
- Multi-file projects via the loader
- Built-in `print` for `int`, `bool`, and `str`
- Single-line (`//`) and block (`/* */`) comments
- CI workflow building the compiler, running tests, and compiling every
  example with `-ansi -pedantic -Wall`
